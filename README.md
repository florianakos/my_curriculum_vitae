About the online CV
===================

It is a work replicated from this [link](https://github.com/mszep/pandoc_resume), however, modified to my own needs.
In adddion, it offers automation on the build process and push from travis back to Github repository while the output is created.
To set-up auto-push for travis consider reading the tutorial found [here](https://aueb-balab.github.io/courses/tools/travis_ci-p.html#/27) (Section: Auto-deploying gh-pages with Travis (Linux distros)). 
Feel free to mdify it and use it for your own purposes.
